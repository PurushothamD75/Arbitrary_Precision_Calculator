# Arbitrary Precision Calculator 
An **Arbitrary Precision Calculator** implemented in **C** using **Doubly Linked Lists** to handle large numbers and perform basic arithmetic operations like **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**.
---

##  Features
-> Supports large integers beyond the typical data type limits  
-> Handles both **positive** and **negative** integers  
-> Performs accurate **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**  
-> Manages dynamic memory efficiently using **doubly linked lists**  
-> Command-line interface for quick calculations

##  Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C  
- **Data Structure:** Doubly Linked List  
- **Concepts:** Dynamic Memory Allocation, Command-line Arguments, Arithmetic Operations

How It Works
-> The calculator reads the input as strings.
-> Converts strings into doubly linked lists for precision handling.
-> Handles carry, borrow, and sign adjustments internally.
-> Supports long division and multiplication using list-based operations.

Future Scope

-> Add support for floating-point operations.
-> Implement modulus and exponentiation operations.
-> Optimize performance for extremely large calculations.
